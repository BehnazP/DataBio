`Packaged_Installer` folder contains the `MATLAB Runtime` which you `must` install before using any of the software versions.

or

you can download the full MATLAB Runtime from
[MATLAB Runtime](https://se.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html)

In folder `Test Data for WISHARTChange` a time series of SAR data is available for diagonal dual polarization (VV and VH) in two formats: GeoTIFF and ENVI with header files. The data is acquired from Google Earth Engine (GEE), for more detail see the ReadMe file.

`Test Data for MADChange` contains two time points of optical images with 4 bands (B2,B3,B4,B8) from GEE in two formats, GeoTIFF and ENVI with a header file.

For more specific detail, see the `Software_description.pdf`.
